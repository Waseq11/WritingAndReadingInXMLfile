Hello, 
This is an Application that I developed on Visual Studio 2019 using C#.
It takes your First Name and Last Name and if you press on the "Write on XML" button, it creates an XML file and writes your name on it 10 times.
The Read button then reads from that XML file and shows you the result.
I used basic C# coding ways and XMLWriter class to call and code the writing and reading XML File section. Xmlout specifically
The UI is simple that comes with an exit button to quit the program.
